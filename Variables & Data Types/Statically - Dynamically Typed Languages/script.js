// There are two types of languages when it comes to data types:

// Statically typed language where each variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types. Example: C, C++, Java.

// Dynamically typed languages can receive different data types over time. JavaScript is dynamically typed; variables in JavaScript can receive different data types over time. We're going to see this in action really soon.

// A variable in JavaScript can contain any data. A variable can at one moment be a string and at another be a number, for example:

let message = "Hello, World!";

message = 123456;
// ... is a completely valid syntax.
